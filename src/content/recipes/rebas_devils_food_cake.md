title: "Reba's Devils Food Cake"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "One Sunday when Bro. Ingram's family came home from church with us, I went to get the dessert I had made the day before, and it had been eaten. Reba said, \"I can stir you up a little chocolate cake real fast, if you want me to\". She did, and it became the favorite of the whole family (she had to bake another one so she could tell me how she made it). This is the cake I make for all the GRANDCHILDREN. I like Fudge Frosting. Cool cake."

- 2 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups sugar
- 6 Tablespoons cocoa
- 3/4 cup shortening
- 1 cup boiling water
- 2 well beaten eggs
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla

Sift flour, soda & salt -- set aside. Mix together sugar and cocoa. Add shortening (no need to stir). Quickly add the boiling water and the flour mixture (this makes it red) and beat with mixer till very smooth. Stir in the well beaten eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla (if you use WATKINS, use less). Bake 30-40 min. at 375 degrees oven until done. Don't overbake and it should be real moist.
