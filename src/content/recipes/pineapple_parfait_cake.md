title: "Pineapple Parfait Cake"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
---

- 2 1/2 cups sifted cake flour
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup Spry (shortening)
- 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind
- 3/4 cup canned pineapple juice
- 1/4 cup water
- 4 egg whites unbeaten

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into mixing bowl. Drop in Spry (I'm not sure they even make that any more) and lemon rind (No pre-creaming with Spry). Add about 2/3 of combined p-apple juice and water and beat 150 strokes. Scrape bowl and spoon often. Add egg whites and beat 250 strokes. Add remaining liquid and beat 50 strokes.

Nadine Kahler and I used to bake this back before mixers when we counted the strokes. I lost my recipe for several years, but got a copy from Nadine. Mixers are GREAT!

Bake in two greased, floured 9 inch pans in moderate over (360 degrees) 20-30 min.

Now frost it!
