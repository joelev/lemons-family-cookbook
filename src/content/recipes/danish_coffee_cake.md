Step 1: 1/2 cup butter or margerine, softened 2 Tablespoons water 1 cup flour Cut margerine into the flour until it feels "grainy". Add water, mix together and divide dough in half. Pat out in rectangles onto 2 cookie sheets. Step 2: Heat to boiling: 1 cup water 1/2 cup butter Remove from heat and add: 1 cup flour 1 teasponn almond extract 3 eggs, slightly beaten Beat until smooth, and spread half on each rectange on cookie sheets. Bake in slow oven for 50 minutes. Step 3: Make glaze by mixing enough milk (about 4 TBS) into 2 cups powdered sugar. Step 4: Spread glaze over the baked cakes, and then spread a thin layer of preserves on top. I prefer peach or apricot. It is better served warm. Jaunita Babcoke made this for us, and I liked it real well. I made it for coffee one morning, and all my friends said, "it's all right, but we would rather have your cinnamon rolls". Try it at least once.
