Make crust, roll out and press in pan. Fill crust with any fresh or cooked fruit. Add 1 cup sugar and 1 Tablespoon flour or cornstarch for most fruits. Gooseberries will need 1/2 cup more. For apple pie you will want to add cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, or just use apple or pumpkin pie spice mixture. Dot generously with butter, and place top crust over it. Be sure to make openings in top crust to let steam escape. Seal and flute the edges, and brush the top crust lightly with milk (this will make the top glossy). Bake in 425 degrees oven 35 to 45 minutes.

Out favorites are APPLE, BLACKBERRY, CHERRY, and I try to pick and freeze enough GOOSEBERRIES to have for David and Sherry. We MUST have whipped or ice cream or top -- or it is great hot with butter.
