- 1/2 cups sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 3 packages yeast
- 2 1/2 cups flour

Mix together in large bowl.

Place 3/4 cup water, 3/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup butter in sauce-pan and heat until very warm. Mix gradually into the flour mixture & beat 2 minutes, then add 3 1/2 cups flour, or enough to make a soft dough. Knead.

Put in greased bowl, cover & let rise till double. Divide & shape into loaves or rolls, let rise & bake at 400 degrees 35 minutes, until done.

Sue made these for Naomi's birth-day dinner one year, and they were real good -- sweeter and richer than mine.
