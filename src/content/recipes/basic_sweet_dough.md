- 1 cup warm water
- 2 packages yeast
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 cups scalded milk
- 3 well beaten eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla (if desired)
- 1/2 cup margerine
- 6-8 cups flour

In a large bowl mix the water, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon of the sugar to start yeast. Scald milk in sauce-pan, stir in the rest of the sugar, margerine, salt, vanilla, and the well beaten eggs. When mixture is luke-warm, stir in the yeast mixture and 4 cups of the flour. Beat until well blended and smooth. Add enough of the flour to make dough thick enough to work with. Remove to floured board, & let rest 10 minutes.

Knead till rubbery then place in oiled bowl, cover and let rise until double in bulk -- about 2 1/2 hours. Remove to floured board, knead lightly, divide in half, then form to make Doughnuts, Long Johns, or Cinnamon Rolls.
