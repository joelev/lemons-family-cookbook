On floured board, roll one ball of the dough as thin as possible. It will be hard to stretch as it will be "rubbery". Mix together:

- 2 cups sugar
- 3 Tablespoons WATKINS cinnamon
- 1/2 stick melted margerine
- Milk or cream to make smooth paste.

Spread 1/2 over dough, roll up & cut into 1 inch thick slices. Place in oiled pan. Repeat with other ball of dough. Let rise.

Bake 375 degrees until lightly brown (25-30 min.). Ice while hot with creamy and caramel icing.

1/3 cup soft margerine, 3 cups powdered sugar, & enough milk to make creamy. Divide in half, & add 1 tsp. vanilla to spread on one pan. Add brown sugar and nuts in the other half to make caramel icing for the other pan. These are best when freshly baked.
