Cream together:

- 1 cup shortening
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar

Add & beat well: 2 eggs

Add 2 Tablespoons hot water

Sift together, then add to creamed mixture:

- 2 1/2 cups sifted all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Fold in:

- 1 cup nutmeats (if desired)
- 1/2 pound chocolate chips

Esther forms a long roll of the dough, and wraps in wax paper or foil, & stores in the refrigerator to chill. She then just slices off a few as she needs them and bakes. I think she made them almost every morning for the grandchildren and Mom while she was staying with them after her first stroke. She bakes them 10 min. at 400 degrees. I never could have enough dough left over to store -- I just baked them, and we ate them. That is when they are best.
