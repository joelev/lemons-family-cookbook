Icing: Make first & refrigerate

- 1 1/4 cups sugar
- 2 cups dairy sour cream
- 2 7oz cans flaked coconut
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 small container Cool Whip

Reserve 3/4 cup coconut to sprinkle over cake. Mix other ingredients by hand and refrigerate over-night.

Cake:

1 package Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. Use milk instead of water, and bake in 2 layer pans according to the directions. Cool. Carefully slice each layer in the center to make 4 layers -- this is a little tricky. Ice between layers as you stack them, and over top and sides of cake. Sprinkle with the 3/4 cup of coconut. Keep cake refrigerated til ready to serve.
