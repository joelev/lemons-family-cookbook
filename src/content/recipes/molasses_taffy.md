- 2 cups sugar
- 1 cup light molasses
- 1/3 cup water
- 2 teaspoons vinegar
- 2 Tablespoons butter or margerine
- 1/2 teaspoon soda

Butter sides of heavy 2 quart saucepan. Combine sugar, molasses, & water. Heat slowly, stirring constantly, till sugar dissolves. Bring to boil. Add vinegar & cook till it spins thread from spoon and forms firm, but not brittle ball when dropped into cold water. Remove pan from heat and stir in margerine & soda to mix well.

Turn out onto buttered platter or pan. When it is just cool enough to handle (can start with forks) butter hands & start pulling from one hand to the other. Divide in enough pieces so each person can have a lump to pull. It can be a little messy, so I used to tie tea towels around everybody's next & hair before we began -- of course you had to wash your hands and grease them butter.

Pull until it gets hard to upll & is light taffy colored -- the longer you can pull the better it will be. Pull into long strands, twist & cut into bite-size pieces with scissors. Wrap each piece in wax paper, twist each and store -- if you have any left after you get it pulled.

We always ate most of it as we pulled. This was the only kind of candy we ever made we were kids. We always made enough sorgum in the summer to last all winter. Neighbor Jackie Phillips had a mill & the whole neighbor-hood brought cane & worked together to make it. It was a great adventure for us, but I'm sure standing over the hot vats and stirring and pushing was not much fun for the folks.

Sugar was so scarce I know we made it with just the sorgum, but I've forgotten how & this is the nearest I can find. Vinegar taffy is made the same except for the ingredients -- (for those who hate sorgum).
