- 2 packages dry yeast
- 1 Tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 cup very warm water
- 1 3/4 cups milk
- 1/4 cup butter
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 6 cups flour
- Cornmeal

Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Heat milk, butter, and salt in a saucepan until butter is melted. Cool to luke-warm and add to yeast. Add 4 cups flour, beat batter well. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

Stir down, add remaining 2 cups flour to make a stiff dough. Knead on a floured board until smooth and elastic. Turn in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled -- about 1 hour in a warm place, overnight in the refrigerator.

Punch down, pat out 1/2 inch thick, cut into 3 inch rounds. Dust both sides with cornmeal; let rise until double. On a lightly greased griddle over low heat, carefully brown on both sides. To serve, split & toast.
