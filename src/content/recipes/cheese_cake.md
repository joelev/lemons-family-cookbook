- 3 well beaten eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 8 oz. packages cream cheese (not soft)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (if desired)
- 2 cups dairy sour cream

Mix in order listed and pour over graham cracker crust. Bake at 375 degrees degrees till done in the middle -- it will probably take 30 to 40 minutes. Serve plain, or use any topping you like. Kirk likes Blueberry best.
