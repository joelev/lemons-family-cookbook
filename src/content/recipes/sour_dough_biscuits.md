- 1 cup warm water
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoon soda
- 1/4 teaspoon soda
- 3/4 cups oil
- 6 cups flour (or more if needed)

Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add rest of ingredients in order given and mix well. The dough should be stiff enough to handle, but not as stiff as for hot rolls. Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover with loose fitting cover or wrap, and store in refrigerator. You can just pinch out and form into rolls, or I think it is a little easier to handle if you put them on a floured surface. Place in greased pan and bake at 420 degrees, 15 or 20 minutes, or until done. No need to let them rise before you bake them.

Suzanne especially likes these.
