story: "Theresa left out the carrots, but I like them or some pimentos for color."

- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 cup pure apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon celery seed
- 1 teaspoon mustard seed

Combine above ingredients, stir & add:

- 1 large head cabbage, chopped fine
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 green pepper, chopped
- 1 cup carrots, shredded

Let stand overnight, and just dip out what you need to serve. This will freeze, but is not quite so crisp as when fresh.
