story: "Season with a little butter or bacon and salt to taste. Most people used to use lye to skin the corn, but my mother was so afraid we would get poisoned , she used the soda and took a little longer, but it was delicious."

My dad used to grow the big white kernel "Hickory Cane" corn and bring it down to me to make hominy. The corn needs to be fully ripe and hard, but be sure if you buy it that it has not been treated any way that would make it unsafe to eat. Shell and wash well before you start.

Use a very large dish pan or kettle & fill not more than half full of corn. Cover well with water & add half-box soda (or more, depending on how much corn you have), and boil until the skin of the corn begins to rub off, and the dark end can be easily removed. This will take a lot of hours, so watch it closely so that it does not stick to bottom of pan. Needs to be cooked slowly over low heat, and stir often. When the corn is done, and the hull can be rubbed off, drain soda water off and wash, wash, wash, until the hominy is white and fluffy.
