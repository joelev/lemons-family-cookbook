Sherry made this for us to eat when Mike got home at night from his classes at Florida Institute of Technology when they were at Satellite Beach. We just took it out of the over and ate it hot with butter and coffee. I ate a LOT, and it was GREAT! We had a wonderful time on this trip -- walked on the beach every morning with the family. Must have been in 1978 -- Greg was just a little guy.
