title: "Quick Creamy Icing"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "Cream and beat together until smooth enough to spread. You may need to stir in a little more milk if you just want to drizzle it over cake. This is the cake Jo Souder of Memphis makes a lot. It is a good big cake to take to dinners, and it also freezes well."
