category: main-dishes-meats-vegetables
story: "Lorea used to flour the roast then sear to brown on both sides, add water, then cover to cook. When about half done, add 1 onion, 1 stalk celery, 2 or 3 carrots & enough potatoes for a meal. You will have better gravy if you pour off enough broth before you add the vegetables."

Buy at least a 3 or 4 lb roast -- eye of the rib is best. Trim off fat, wash meat, salt & pepper well. I usually just place on a rack in skillet, add water to cover rack, but not the roast, cover and cook in oven about 3 hours at 350 degrees or until done.
