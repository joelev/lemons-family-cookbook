title: "Barbara's Pork Chops & Potatoes"
category: main-dishes-meats-vegetables
story: "I usually first brown my pork chops a little so the will be thoroughly cooked (Wayne thinks I over cook all my meat, but I can't stand it even a little bit rare). I also sometimes cook in microwave a few minutes to start it, then put in oven to finish. It is good with other kinds of meat -- especially chicken breasts."

Barbara makes a very tasty meal by just slicing raw potatoes & onions in a baking dish & placing pork chops on top. Add salt & pepper then pour a can of cream of chicken or mushroom soup & 1/2 cup milk over it. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until meat is tender.
