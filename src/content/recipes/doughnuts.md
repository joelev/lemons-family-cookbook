story: "The best way to make doughnuts is just to stand there and fry while everyone else eats -- that way you don't have to worry where to put them. This makes a big batch."

Roll out the Basic Sweet Dough as thin as possible. Cut for doughnuts (I never did have a cutter, so I used a glass and a VERY CLEAN thimble to cut the holes).

Let rise till double, then fry in medium hot oil (probably 400 degrees in electric fryer or skillet). Don't try to fry more than 3 or 4 at a time or it will cool your oil. When both sides have been browned, carefully remove and drain well. A paper bag with paper towels over it works well. When dry dip in a thin glaze and place on plates to drain.
