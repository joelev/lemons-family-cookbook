story: "This is the kind of food Dad & I used to eat out, but after we couldn't I made these quite a lot. He loved them, & I suppose the flavor was distinct enough he could taste them better than the bland foods -- they never hurt his stomach."

Toast rye bread either in toaster or on the griddle. Place a slice of Swiss cheese on toast, a layer of sliced corned beef, a layer of drained sauerkraut, sprinkle with the seeds Sherry does not eat (Caraway), top with another slice of Swiss cheese, then the other slice of toast.

Heat until the cheese melts -- they will be tough if you microwave these. Good.
