- 1 pound chicken breasts per person, boned and cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 egg per pound of chicken breasts
- 1/4 cup milk per egg
- flour
- peanut oil
- salt & pepper

Flour chicken & let stand 15 minutes. Mix eggs, milk, salt & pepper in mixing bowl. Put all of the chicken in egg mixture; let stand 10 minutes. Let oil get hot, then dip each piece of chicken into flour & drop into hot oil to brown on both sides. Drain & keep warm.

This is the complicated was I first made it, and Wayne said, "This is good, but the chicken is not as good as the way you always fry it". So after that I just cut up my chicken breasts, soak them an hour or so in salt water (1/2 teaspoon salt per pound chicken), take them out & shake them in a bag of flour, 1/2 ts. salt, 1/2 ts. pepper, and fry them in hot oil.

We really don't care for the heavy breaded taste & we certainly don't need the eggs. I used Wesson instead of peanut oil, and it is just as good I think. Experiment.

Oyster Sauce

This recipe calls for 1 cup water and 1 chicken bullion cube, I used a cup of the broth that I boiled the "boney" pieces of the breast in. It was better.

For each cup of liquid, stir in 1 Tablespoon corn-starch and 1 teaspoon oyster flavored sauce (I used La Hoy). Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens. I stir a few chopped cashews in. When ready to eat, pour over chicken & sprinkle with chopped cashews & green onions. Good.

Chinese Rice

Boil 1 cup rice in 2 cups water (add a little bit of margerine and it won't boil over). Let cool & dry out a little so it won't be sticky. Brown 3 slices of diced bacon in heavy skillet. Push to side of skillet & turn down the heat. Scamble an egg or 2 in the bacon drippings & add teh rice & 2 or 3 chopped green onions.

Now add soy sauce till it is as brown as you like it.
