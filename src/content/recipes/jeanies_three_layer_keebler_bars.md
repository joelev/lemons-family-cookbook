- Club Crackers
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup crushed graham crackers
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 stick margerine
- 2/3 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup butterscotch chips

Line a lightly greased 9 x 11 inch pan with whole club crackers. Boil sugars, graham crackers, milk and margerine -- a slow boil, stirring constantly. Pour over crackers in pan and add another layer of crackers.

Melt together peanut butter & chocolate & butterscotch chips. Pour over crackers and cool.

After they have "set", very carefully cut in between lines of the Keebler Crackers to make bars. I can never get mine to look as pretty as Jeanie (Holland) does, but these are good.
