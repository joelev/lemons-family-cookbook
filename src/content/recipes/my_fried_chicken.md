Soak cut up chicken in salt water for an hour or so if you have time (1/2 tsp. salt per pound). Or just sprinkle with salt as you flour it. I cut the breasts in small pieces so they will be crisper -- also so I will get a piece, since my Dad always spoiled me to eat the white meat. Wayne always made sure I had the kind I liked, so I buy extra breasts. I just put an ample amount of flour (1 cup), 1 tsp. salt, & a little pepper in a bread wrapper, take the chicken out of the salt water & drop it in bag with flour. Shake well to coat chicken with flour.

Fry in oil moderately hot -- 340 degrees in electric skillet, or until a pinch of flour "sizzles" when dropped into oil. Cover tightly till brown on one side, then turn over, reduce heat & fry uncovered until the other side is done. Heat the oil first & don't crowd it in the pan. It should be crispy on the outside, yet done inside.

Everybody in the family likes fried chicken -- especially Kevin.
