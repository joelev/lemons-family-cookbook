Mix shortening and sugar until creamy. Add beaten eggs. Mash bananas and add them to mixture, also the nuts. (Kirk will not eat anything with nuts in it).

Sift the flour several times with the salt and soda, add to mixture. Bake in a well greased & floured pan in moderate over (350 degrees) until done. Turn out of pan and cool on rack.
