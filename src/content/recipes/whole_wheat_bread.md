I just use the same basic recipe except use 2 cups whole wheat as part of the flour, and substitute honey or sorgum for the sugar. Or if you want it a little richer, use part milk and add an egg. Eula Lee Lowe makes good bread using the following recipe with flour Bill grinds, and passes along to us too.

Mix 2 packages yeast and 1/2 teaspoon honey in 1/2 cup lukewarm water. Let stand for 5 minutes.

Pour 1 1/2 cups scalded milk over the following in a mixer bowl:

- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1 teaspoon salt

Cool until lukewarm. Add yeast, 2 eggs, 2 cups whole wheat flour, and 2 cups bread [flour] (or regular). Beat 4 minutes at medium speed.

Stir in: 2cups w. wheat & 1 1/2 to 2 cups reg. flour to make a fairly firm dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Let rise till doubled. Punch down & let rest 10-15 minutes. Makes 3 loaves.

Bake 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees, or in my over 375 degrees is better.

I take a lot of liberty with my bread -- I sometimes ever toss in a little cracked wheat or rye flour. For rye, top with caraway seeds -- but not if Sherry is here.
