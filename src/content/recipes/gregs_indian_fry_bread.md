title: "Greg's Indian Fry Bread"
category: quickbreads-muffins-pancakes
story: "Gred made these in his Home Ec. class while I was in Ft. Huachuca, AZ, March 21, 1988. He then treated us all to a \"batch\" at home. They were great! Later we went to visit the Old San Havier Mission and bought them from young Indian girls who were frying them over an open fire using the centers of Cholla cactus stems to burn. We toured the mission, climbed the moutain and had a very good day with Mike's family."

- 2 cups flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon powdered milk
- 3/4 cup warm water
- Lard or other shortening for frying

Combine all the dry ingredients, pour in water and mix until dough can be gathered into a ball. Divide the dough into six or eight equal pieces. Roll each piece into an 8 inch circle, paper thin. Poke a hole in center of each circle.

Heat shortening (1 inch deep) in heavy 10 inch skillet. Pull & stretch each ball of dough until it is thin as paper, then drop into hot shortening & fry until each side is a light golden brown -- will have to turn with tongs. Bread will puff up. Drain on paper towels & serve with one of the following: butter, jelly, honey, powdered sugar, cinnamon, or can be used like shells with beans, cheese, meat, etc on them. I liked the ones with plain powdered sugar on them best.
