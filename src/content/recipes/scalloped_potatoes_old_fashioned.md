Peel & slice 4 large potatoes. Stir in enough flour to coat the potatoes. Add 1 tsp. salt. Place in a baking dish that has been greased with butter. Cover with milk, sprinkle with pepper, & dot with butter. Cook in 350 degrees oven until done -- about an hour.

Mike always liked these -- so do I. If you want to make cheese potatoes, just add 1/4 cup Velveta.
