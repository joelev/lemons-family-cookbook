This is the favorite of the whole family. This recipe makes two pies. Beat together (or I use blender):

- 2 cups home canned or frozen pumpkin
- 3 eggs

Sift together:

- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 Tablespoons flour
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Mix with eggs and pumpkin until smooth. Add 1 cup cream (I use Milnot) and 1 cup milk.

Blend until creamy. Pour into unbaked pie crust. Sprinkle with WATKINS cinnamon and bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees and bake another 25 min. or until done. Watch closely. Sometimes the crust will burn before the filling is done. Cook until center is just "set". Serve with whipped cream.

To prepare the pumpkin for cooking—Cut pumpkin in half, and scrape out the pulp and seeds. Cut into thin strips then cut into small chunks. Put into large pot and add enough water to just barely cover pumpkin. Boil over low heat until pumpkin is tender and will be 'mushy'. Pack into bags or containers and freeze. If you can it you will have to use a pressure cooker or it will spoil.
