- 1/4 cup margerine
- 1 pk. marshmallows (10 oz. or about 40)
- 6 cups RICE KRISPIES CEREAL

Melt margerine in large saucepan over low heat. Add marshmallows (if you want to use miniature ones use 4 cups), and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat and quickly stir in the rice krispies until well coated. Using greased spatula press mixture into greased 13 by 9 inch pan. Cut into squares when cool.

When Ray Powell was working on our house one time, he told Ruth, "Why don't you make these kids some of that krispy stuff, and bring it to them". She did, and we probably made more of these for bake sales than any other thing. I'm sure I spent more making them than they brought, but they are so good & easy.
