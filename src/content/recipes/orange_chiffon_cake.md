title: "Orange Chiffon Cake"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "This is an exact copy of this recipe that first came out in LOOK magazine probably 1946 -- any-way, shortly after Wayne came home from Guam. It was touted as the first innovation in cake baking for more than a hundred years. I baked it for Wayne's birthday that first year, and I can only think of one other birthday I have missed. It also is a favorite of the rest of the family -- especially Sarah."

GET READY: Heat oven to 325 degrees (slow moderate). Sift an ample amount of Softa-silk Cake Flour onto a square of paper.

STEP 1: (level measurements throughout) and sift into mixing bowl:

- 2 1/4 cups sifted Softasilk Cake Flour (spoon lightly into cup, don't pack)
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 3 teaspoons double-action baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt

Make a well and add in order:

- 1/2 cup cooking (salad) oil such as Mazola or Wesson (ingredient "X")
- 5 unbeaten egg yolks (medium sized)
- Grated rind of 2 oranges (about 2 TS.)
- Juice of 2 medium-sized oranges, plus water to make 3/4 cup

BEAT with spoon until SMOOTH.

STEP 2: Measure into large mixing bowl:

- 1 cup egg whites (7 or 8)
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter

WHIP until whites form VERY STIFF peaks. They should be much stiffer than for Angel Food or Meringue. DO NOT UNDERBEAT (That is a LOT of strokes with a FORK)!

STEP 3: POUR egg-yolk mixture gradually over whipped egg whites -- GENTLY folding with rubber scraper JUST until blended. DO NOT STIR. POUR into ungreased pan immediately. Use 10 inch tube pan, 4 inches deep. BAKE 65 minutes in slow moderate over (350 degrees). Immediately turn pan upside down, placing tube part over neck of funnel or bottle. Let hang free of table, until cold. Loosen from sides and tube with spatula. Turn pan over and hit on table to loosen.
