- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 cup milk
- Nutmeg
- Cold biscuits

Beat together the egg, sugar, salt, milk, and vanilla. Add enough cold biscuits (broken up into small pieces) to make a thin lumpy batter. Pour into greased pan, sprinkle lightly with nutmeg, and bake at 350 degrees until done -- 15 to 20 minutes.

Mom used to make this a lot and we would pour good, thick cream over it. It was something she could make with what we had on the farm to cook with.
