Roll dough in long slim shape. Cut in one inch strips. No need to let rise -- just pull and stretch each piece of dough, & fry as for doughnuts.

These are so much easier and faster that I never bother cutting out the doughnuts. I can't tell any difference in the taste of texture -- and Mike's Boy Scout Troop didn't complain about the shape. I don't make these much, except when Mike is home. My mom used to make cake doughnuts when we butchered hogs (that was the only time we had fresh lard to fry them in), but my children never cared much for them so I never make them. I never could make them taste like her's did. I don't suppose she had a recipe, but she rolled them in sugar & cinnamon, and I remember they were a real treat once a year.
