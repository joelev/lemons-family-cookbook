story: "This is a very rich heavy cake -- more like candy. This is a cake the ladies in Memphis always fix for the church conference."

- 2 cups sugar
- 4 eggs
- 2 sticks margerine
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup cocoa
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
- 1 1/2 cups flaked coconut

Cream together eggs, sugar, and margerine. Add remaining ingredients, and stir until mixed -- this will be a stiff batter. Spread in a sheet-type greased and floured pan -- about 9 by 13 inches. Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove from oven and immediately spread with a 7 oz. or larger jar of marshmallow cream.

- 1/3 cup cocoa
- 1 stick margerine
- 1/3 cup milk (or evaporated type)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 lb. powdered sugar

Melt margerine and stir in milk, cocoa, vanilla, and powdered sugar. Mix, and spread on top of the marshmallow cream while cake is still hot. I usually add some coconut and pecans.
