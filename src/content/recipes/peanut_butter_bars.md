title: "Peanut Butter Bars"
category: candies-cookies-confections
story: "This is the only peanut butter cookie Wayne will eat. Virginia Potter makes them at the Vo Tech School, and sent this recipe to me. She is a great cook. These have the consistency of Brownies. I never could make very good Chocolate Brownies, so just used a mix for them. That was cheating, but everyone was glad."

- 1/3 cup shortening
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

Mix together shortening, sugar & eggs. Stir in flour, salt & baking powder which has been sifted together. Stir in vanilla and peanute butter (I prefer the chunky kind) and bake 25 minutes in 275 degrees or 300 degrees oven. Mixture will be thick and must be spread in pan (I use glass cake pan) with hand or back of spoon.
