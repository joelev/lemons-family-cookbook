story: "For the gravy, just take out the amount of liquid you will need (with Glen here it will take more), add the chopped giblets (liver & gizzard) & heat over low heat till hot, but not boiling. I don't measure this, but mix enough sifted flour into hot water to make a smooth thin paste, & stir enough into stock to make gravy as YOU like -- I like mine thin. Next to fried chicken I think turkey is the family's favorite food."

You probably won't be able to get a fresh turkey, so thaw frozen one completely. It will take at least 2 days in the refrigerator. If you are in a hurry, thaw in a pan of cold water -- or put out in a COLD room. I have tried different kinds, but I can't tell much difference and if you want a large one (18-20 lbs) you will have to get a tom. Make sure the turkey is clean and dry. Rub outside with margarine. Measure into dish 1/2 ts. salt per each pound of turkey. Rub part of it on the outside & the rest inside the cavity. I then completely wrap the turkey in heavy duty aluminum foil, placing extra folds over the breast & legs so they won't burn.

Place turkey breast side up on a rack in a large roaster or pan -- be sure to put a rack under it or it will scorch. Cover bottom of pan with at least an inch of water & start in a 350 degrees oven for about an hour to get it started. You will have to add water as needed as it bakes.

I like to start mine about 9:00 or so the night before to get it started, then turn over to 200 degrees & cook all night. I check it if I wake up during the night, but if you have plenty of water in the pan it will be o.k.

When about done, uncover & cook awhile longer to brown. I boil the neck & giblets in a separate pan without salt so I can have plenty of broth for dressing & gravy. Punch hole in bottom of foil to let juice drain, then mix with the unsalted till it suits your taste -- the turkey stock will be pretty salty, but the meat will be about right.
