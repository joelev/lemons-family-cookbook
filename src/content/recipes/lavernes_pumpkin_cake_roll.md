title: "Laverne's Pumpkin Cake Roll"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "For filling: soften 6 oz. cream cheese, 4 Tablespoons butter or margarine, 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until very smooth. Spread over cake, then re-roll the cake and chill. When ready to serve, slice into 1/2 inch slices. This makes a pretty dessert to serve just alone -- it is so rich & good. Laverne made this for us the last time we visited her in Ajo, Az. 10/31/1985."

Beat 3 eggs on high speed for 5 minutes. Gradually beat in 1 cup granulated sugar. Stir in 1/3 cup pumpkin & 1 ts lemon juice.

Stir together 3/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Fold into pumpkin mixture. Spread in greased & floured 16 x 10 x 1 inch pan. Chop 1 cup English walnuts very fine and press into the top of batter. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 to 15 minutes, then loosen with spatula and carefully turn out on towel sprinkled with powdered sugar. Starting at narrow end, roll cake and towel together. Cool. Unroll -- this is a little tricky.
