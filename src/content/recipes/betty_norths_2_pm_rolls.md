title: "Betty North's 2 P.M. Rolls"
category: yeast-breads-rolls-sweet-dough
story: "Thesse really rise if left out overnight as the recipe evidently implies, so I think it is much better to start the recipe at 7:00 or 8:00 a.m. and bake around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. This makes a lot of rolls and they freeze so well you can keep on hand or make ahead of time. Of course I usually don't make these, but Betty North brought these to a church dinner & they were delicious. Would be convenient for working Moms who do not have time for much baking."
