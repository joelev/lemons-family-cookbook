I usually use a creamy icing I make with orange juice instead of milk. Probably will take about (I don't measure this):

- 1/2 stick margerine
- 3 Tablespoons orange juice
- 1 teaspoon grated orange rind
- 2 cups powdered sugar

Beat until creamy and smooth enough to spread over cake. If you need it thinner just add a little more juice or a little water (not milk). It is good just drizzled down over the sides of the cake -- however you like it.

By the way, in case you don't remember, the birthday we missed was the one in 1966 when we were on vacation in the Smokies and the South Eastern states. We bought Cinnamon rolls in Georgia at a little shopping center and took them back to the motel. Remember? I'm sure the highlight of that trip for Steve was when I finally got to eat some real GRITS.
