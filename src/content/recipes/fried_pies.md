- 1 cup sweet milk
- 1/4 cup oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

Mix in bowl, and add enough flour to make a dough stiff enough to handle. Turn onto floured board and roll thin. Cut into 4 inch squares. Fill with any kind of dried fruit, which has been cooked, sweetened and flavored to suit your taste. Dot with butter. Fold over to make triagle. Seal edges well, and crimp or flute so juice will not ooze out. Prick with fork to let steam escape. Carefully place into HOT oil, brown one side, then turn and brown other. Drain well, and serve hot.

These are delicious -- my favorite is peach with butter on it.
