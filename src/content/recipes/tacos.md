In heavy skillet, fry 2 lbs. good ground beef till well done. Add 1 package taco seasoning mix, & 1 can tomato paste or sauce. Fry (or bake in oven) plenty of corn taco shells. Shred a big plate of mixed cheeses. Make a big platter of choped onions, tomatoes, green peppers, & shredded lettuce.

Let everybody make his own -- have plenty of salsa, hot sauce, & corn chips. Better drink Coke or Pepsi.
