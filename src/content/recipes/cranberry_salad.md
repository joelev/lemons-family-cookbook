title: "Cranberry Salad"
category: salads

- 1 package raw cranberries
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 2 peeled oranges
- 2 raw apples
- 1/2 cup pecans or English walnuts

Place in blender and chop to a coarse consistency. I make this Thanksgiving and freeze half of it for Christmas. Not many of the family will even taste it, but I just can't cook turkey dinner and not have some kind of cranberries -- I keep hoping some of the in-laws or maybe even a grandchild will like it. I have tried adding crushed pineapple and some Cool Whip, but they still don't like it.

I'll keep trying ... it is SO good.
