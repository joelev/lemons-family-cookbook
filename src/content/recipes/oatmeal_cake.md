Cut 1 stick margerine into small pieces in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup quick oatmeal and 1 1/2 cups boiling water. Let stand 20 minutes. Add 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. Stir, and add 2 unbeaten eggs. Beat well. Sift together:

- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon soda
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Add to first mixture, and beat well. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/2 cup nuts and/or raisins. I leave out the raisins and use 1 cup nuts. Most of the family will not eat raisins. Kirk won't eat nuts so if he is here I leave them out, too. Bake in large cake pan at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until done. While cake is warm, pour over it a blend of:

- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 6 teaspoons margerin
- 1 cup coconut
- 1/2 cup pecans

Place under broiler and lightly brown. Steve especially likes this cake.
