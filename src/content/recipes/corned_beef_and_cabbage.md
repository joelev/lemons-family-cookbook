story: "I like vinegar with mine, and a big pan of corn bread, or I made whole wheat rye hot rolls of Naomi, Bert, Esther, Ralph & Betty. They enjoyed it."

In a large baking dish, shred a layer of raw cabbage. Place a layer of thinly sliced potatoes over this. Add another layer of cabbage (can put a layer of onions but I prefer it without). Cook in oven or microwave until vegetables are tender. I use enough of the broth to flavor them -- taste to be sure broth is not too salty and dilute if needed. Put a nice layer of the sliced beef on top, sprinkle with caraway seeds (if Sherry is not here) & cook in oven until meat is good & hot.
