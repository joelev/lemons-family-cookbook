- 2 eggs beaten

Stir in and mix well:

- 2 cups milk
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 cup oil
- 2 cups flour

It may not take quite 2 cups of flour -- keep the batter thin enough to easily pour on hot griddle.

Make as for pancakes except separate the eggs and fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites last. Be sure the iron is hot and keep well greased or they will STICK. Connie loves waffles.
