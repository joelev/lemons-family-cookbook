- 2 packages carrots
- 1 medium onion (sliced thin)
- 1/2 chopped green pepper
- 1 can tomato soup
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup vinegar
- 1/2 cup salad oil

Pare & slice carrots, cook in salted water until tender. Drain and place in bowl with onion & pepper. In saucepan, mix & bring to boil the other ingredients. Pour hot mixture over the vegetables & store in tightly closed container. Will keep in refrigerator for several days -- I have frozen them, but they are a little mushy.

Makes a pretty dish.
