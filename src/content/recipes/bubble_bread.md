story: "Bake at 350 degrees for about 40 min. or until done. Turn out on plate -- this is kind of an easy version of cinnamon rolls."

Combine 1 cup scalded milk, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp. salt: mix together, cool to lukewarm & add 2 pkgs (2 TBS.) yeast. Add 2 beaten eggs & about 4 1/2 cups flour.

Mix to soft dough, turn out on floured board and knead until elastic but not sticky. Place in greased bowl, cover with damp cloth: let rise to double in bulk. Punch down & rest 10 min.

In a saucepan, melt 1 stick butter, hold in pan. In a bowl, combine 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Can add nuts & raisins if you like. Shape dough into balls about the size of a walnut. Roll each in the butter, then in the sugar mixture. Place in greased angel-food cake pan in staggered rows & layers until all the dough is used. Let rise.
