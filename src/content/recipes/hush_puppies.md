story: "Of course, the way to really make them good is to fry fish and just drop them down in around them. This makes a big batch, so I freeze part of them. Either reheat in oven, or even better, fry some more fish and refry them quickly."

- 1 egg
- 3/4 cup sweet milk
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1 1/2 cups cornmeal
- 1 small chopped onion

Beat egg and add remaining ingredients, mixing well. The batter will be thick, but should not be real stiff or they will be heavy. If you prefer to use buttermilk instead of sweet, add 1/2 teaspoon soda. Drop by teaspoonfuls into deep hot (375 degrees) oil, frying only a few at a time till brown. Drain well and serve hot.
