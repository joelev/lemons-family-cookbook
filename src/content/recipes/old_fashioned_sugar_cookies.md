Sift together:

- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon soda
- 1/2 cup sugar

Cut in:

- 1/2 cup shortening until mixture resembles coarse corn meal.

Blend in:

- 1 egg
- 2 Tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

Roll out on floured board to 1/16-inch thickness. Cut in various shapes and place on ungreased cookie sheet.

Decorate with colored sugar or brush with egg whites and top with grated coconut, chopped nuts, or just bake plain to decorate after they are baked. Bake at 400 degrees 6 to 8 minutes.

I never did really enjoy baking cookies, but these are the easiest ones to roll out I ever made -- and I DID bake them once in a while. That was before mixes.
