title: "Lorea's Home Made Ice Cream"
category: candies-cookies-confections
story: "Lorea sometimes added strawberries or fresh peaches to her ice cream, but I prefer them on top of it. I was only 8 years old when Naomi & Paul and Lorea & Kenneth were married. Most of my summers were spent helping Lorea with the chores of a very busy, big farm. I learned so much about cooking, cleaning, gardening, raking the lawn & making flower beds, & just a lot about doing things I had never done before Lorea took care of me as a baby, while Naomi carried Ralph on her hip."

- 5 eggs
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 pint whipping cream
- 3 quarts half and half
- 3 Tablespoons Watkins vanilla
- Milk to finish filling freezer 3/4 full

Beat eggs, sugar & salt till very fluffy & light colored. Add rest of ingredients in order, mixing well and freeze. This makes 1 1/2 gal. very rich ice cream. It freezes better in the old crank-type freezer, but I don't have mine any more.
