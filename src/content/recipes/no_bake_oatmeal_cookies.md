title: "No Bake Oatmeal Cookies"
category: candies-cookies-confections
story: "Mix sugar, butter, cocoa and milk in saucepan. Bring to boil quickly. Reduce heat to medium and boil 3 or 4 minutes, or until forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water. Stir in peanut butter -- I like to use the chunky kind, and leave out the nuts. Stir in oats and vanilla. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper (freezer paper works better), or I usually just spread in a greased cookie sheet then cut in squares."
