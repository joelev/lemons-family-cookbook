- 1/2 lb. (2 sticks) margerine
- 1 cup crunchy peanut butter
- 1/3 lb (1 pk) graham cracker crumbs
- 1 lb. (3 cups) powdered sugar
- 1 12 oz. package chocolate chips

Melt margerine (or butter) in saucepan. Stir in peanut butter. Put graham crackers in bread sack and roll until smooth with rolling pin. Put fine rolled graham crackers in mixing bowl. Stir in powdered sugar, then the melted butter, peanut butter mixture. Mix well and pour into buttered cake pan. Melt chocolate chips and pour over mixture. Cool and cut into bars. These are a little hard to keep from crumbling, but heat your knife & they cut easier.

These are especially for Kevin -- "they taste just like the real ones."
