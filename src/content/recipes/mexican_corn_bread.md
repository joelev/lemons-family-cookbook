title: "Mexican Corn Bread"
category: quickbreads-muffins-pancakes
story: "Carefully loosen edges and turn out on plate before you cut it. Cut in wedges like pie. This with a salad makes a good meal. Wayne thinks it is just a complicated to \"mess up\" corn bread and hamburger -- I like it."

Step 1

- 1 egg
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 cup cream style corn
- 3/4 teaspoon soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 1/2 cups cornmeal (approximately)

Beat egg and mix other ingredients in order given. Pour half of batter in a well greased pan (a big iron skillet is best) that has been generously coated with meal.

Step 2

- 1 pound hamburger
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 chopped onion
- 2 small chopped jalapeno peppers
- 1/2 cup Velveeta or other cheese

Cook hamburger and salt till done -- drain. Put meat, onion and peppers on top of batter in skillet. Place cheese on top of meat. Pour rest of batter on top and bake 400 degrees oven until done -- may take about 30 minutes. The larger the skillet the thinner the bread will be so will take a little less time to bake.
