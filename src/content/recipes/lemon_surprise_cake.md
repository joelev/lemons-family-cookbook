Dissolve in large mixing bowl, 1 package lemon jello, and 1 cup hot water. Let stand to cool, then beat in:

- 1 lemon or yellow cake mix
- 3/4 cup salad oil
- 4 eggs, one at a time

Beat well, and bake in greased and floured loaf pan at 350 degrees for 15 min. then lower the heat to 300 degrees, and bake another 30 min. or till done. Piece all over the top with fork, and pour mixture of 4 Tablespoons lemon juice and 2 cups powdered sugar over. This forms a glaze over, and runs down into cake.

An easy, delicious cake Edna Lane gave me. Steve loves.
