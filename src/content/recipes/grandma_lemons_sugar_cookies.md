- 3/4 cup butter
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter
- pinch of salt
- 1 1/2 cups flour

Cream butter, add sugar, egg, and dry ingredients. Mix well and form in balls about 1 inch thick. Roll in a cinnamon and sugar mixture, place on cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees until done. These are the ones she always had in her cookie jar when the little ones came to visit -- I'm sure you will remember the taste.
