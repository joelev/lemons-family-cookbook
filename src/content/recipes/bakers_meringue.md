Blend 1 Tablespoon cornstarch in 2 TBS cold water. Add 1/2 cup boiling water and cook until clear & thickened. Let stand until completely cold. Add 1 tsp vanilla. Beat 3 egg whites until just beginning to form peaks. Gradually add 6 Tablespoons sugar beating very slowly; add 1/8 teaspoon salt. Beat in cooked cornstarch & beat until firm peaks form. Spread to touch crust all around. Bake at 375 degrees until browned. Should not weep.
