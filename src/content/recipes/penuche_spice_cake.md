title: "Penuche Spice Cake"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "This is Nadine Kahler's recipe, and the best spice cake I have ever eaten. Lowell, Nadine, & Timmy, Bob, Ruby & Gary Strickland, Wayne, Connie & I used to have Sunday dinner together almost every week when Wayne & Lowell first came home from service in the summer of 1946. We used to ride around in the old Rolls Royce three seat touring car Lowell bought in Atlantic City. Mildred Bradly told us she understood why Buffalo had a housing shortage after she saw us. Instead of the 3 boys who used to ride around in the old Model A, there were now 9 of us. Great fun."
