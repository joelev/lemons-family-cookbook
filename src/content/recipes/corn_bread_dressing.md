title: "Corn Bread Dressing"

story: "This is my favorite part of the turkey dinner. Left over dressing is good in the microwave, but the turkey and gravy is better if re-warmed in a pan or in the oven. Wayne loves cold turkey & left over buns."

Don't ever throw out corn bread -- freeze for dressing. It will take a big bowl full to make enough dressing for our gang. Break corn bread into small pieces into a large bowl. If you don't have enough, add a little white toast -- I prefer all corn bread.

Pour enough turkey broth (not too salty) over bread crumbs to moisten well. Add 1 chopped onion, 1 stalk chopped celery and as much poultry seasoning & pepper as you like. I use about 1 Tablespoon of the mixed seasoning, and try to have fresh sage leaves for the extra good flavor. Crumble the leaves off stalk, & just add and taste till the blend is right.

I usually then add 2 beaten eggs & stir in well. This makes it a little lighter, but it tastes just as good if you leave them out. You can add some of the chopped giblets, but I like it better without them. I do not add extra butter, but be sure to grease pans well before you pour in to bake. Bake at 350 degrees till done -- probably 45 minutes or so. I like it good and brown.
