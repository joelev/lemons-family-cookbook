Pizza Dough

- 3/4 cup warm water
- 1 Tablespoon yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 Tablespoons oil
- 2 1/2 cups flour (approximately)

Sprinkle yeast in warm water & stir to dissolve. Some yeast requires a little sugar to activate, so you may need to add a pinch of sugar. Stir in salt & oil. Mix in enough flour to form a stiff dough. Turn out on floured board & knead till smooth. Place in greased bowl & let rise a few (15-20) minutes.

Remove & stretch dough onto lightly greased pizza pans. Bake in 450 degrees oven just long enough to eat. Remove & add the topping.

Topping

Saute 1 onion in heavy skillet. Add 2 lbs. GOOD hamburger meat & cook till done. Add 1 tsp. salt, 1 TBS chili powder & any other spice you like -- maybe just a dash of oregano, garlic, or basil. Stir in 2 small cans tomato sauce or paste. Pour mixture over partially baked shells (this will make 2 medium sized pizzas) & add your favorite toppings. We liked mushrooms, chopped ham, green peppers, pepperoni, whatever -- I don't like sausage.

Bake this till crust is good & done. Grate a mixture of cheese to sprinkle over top. I use Cheddar, mozzarella, swiss, & a little American. Return to over & bake till the cheese is melted.
