- 2 cups proofed sourdough batter
- 2 3/4 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/2 cup milk

Combine dry ingredients in mixing bowl. Cut butter into dry ingredients until mixture resembles cornmeal. Stir in the milk and sourdough batter and mix well, forming a ball. Knead gently on floured surface about 30 seconds. Roll dough about 1/2 inch thick.

Cut into circles with a cutter. Place apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Cover lightly and let rest for 30 min. Brush tops lightly with some melted butter and bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes or until biscuits have puffed and are golden brown.
