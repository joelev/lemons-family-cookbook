category: cakes-pies-frostings
---

- 2 cups sifted cake flour
- 1 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup soft shortening
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 cup milk
- 1 large unbeaten egg

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease & flour pan. Sift dry ingredients into bowl. Add shortening and 2/3 of the milk. Beat 2 min., med. speed, or 300 strokes by a hand (this one has been around a long time). Add rest of milk, egg, and vanilla. Beat 2 more min. Bake 30 min. While still hot, top with:

Mix 3 Tablespoons softened butter, 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 2 Tablespoons cream or milk, 1/2 cup coconut, and 1/4 cup chopped nuts. Spread over cake, and place under broiler until just "bubbly". Watch closely, or will burn.

We ate a LOT of these in the growing up years. Good, quick, easy, and cheap.
