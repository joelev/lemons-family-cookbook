story: "This will store in a tightly covered container & stay crisp for days. You can also use this for pop corn balls -- just form before baking. To make these with molasses, use pure unsulphered and use following recipe: 1/4 cup sorgum molasses 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup sugar (may omit) 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 Tablespoons butter 1/2 teaspoon soda Boil first 5 ingredients together until it spins a thread or forms hard ball in water. Add soda, and pour over popped corn. Wayne liked this better, but he is a sorgum man, so here again listen to your family. The balls are good with this -- taste like Grandma Lemons used to make for you. I found this recipe of Grandma Lemons so will include it, too. 1/2 cup sorgum 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup water Boil till spins thread, pour over popcorn, & bake in 250 degrees to dry out."

- 4 quarts popped corn
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup butter or margerine
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon soda

Mix brown sugar, butter, syrup and salt. Cook and stir over medium heat until it gets bubbles around the edge. Remove from heat. Stir in soda until mixture is foamy, then pour over popcorn. Place on cookie sheet & bake 1 hour at 200 degrees oven, stirring every 15 minutes. Bake on top rack of oven so they won't scorch. Add peanuts if you want.
