title: "Toasted Coconut Pie"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
---

- 3 well beaten eggs
- 1/2 cup melted butter
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 4 teaspoons lemon juice (bottled o.k.)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups coconut (I use flaked)

Mix ingredients in order and pour into unbaked pie crust. Bake at 350 degrees until done, but not dried out. Probably 35 to 45 minutes.

Mina Lou Parks gave me this recipe, and it is one of my favorites. Missy especially likes it. Lyn doesn't like coconut.
