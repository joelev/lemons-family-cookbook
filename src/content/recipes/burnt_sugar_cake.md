Step 1: Burn the Sugar

- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup boiling water

Melt 1/2 cup sugar in heavy skillet over low heat until clear and medium brown.

This was my father's favorite cake, and the first time Mom tried to make it, she thought she had ruined her sugar when it started to melt.

It will be hard to stir, but when it is brown, remove from heat and gradually stir in 1/2 cup boiling water. Return to heat and stir until lumps are dissolved. Add enough water to make 1 cup for cake..

Since I use burnt sugar for the icing, I use 1 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water (you won't need quite a cup-ful for the icing).

Step 2

- 1 cup sugar
- 2 1/4 cups cake flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 cup soft shortening
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

Sift dry ingredients together in large mixing bowl. Add shortening and 2/3 cup of the carmelized sugar/water mixture. Beat 2 min. Add remaining 1/3 cup car. mixture, eggs, and vanilla. Beat 2 more minutes.

Pour into greased and floured layer cake pans and bake 30-40 min. in 350 degrees Oven. Cool and ice.
