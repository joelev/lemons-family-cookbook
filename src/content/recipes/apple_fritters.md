- 2 eggs
- 1 Tablespoon sugar
- 2 cups sliced apples
- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder

Heat milk until little more than lukewarm. Add slowly to beaten egg yold and sugar mixture. Add the dry ingredients alternately with the stiffly beaten egg whites. Stir in sliced apples. Drop by large spoon-fulls into hot oil and fry until light and brown. Server with maple syrup, or can roll in powdered sugar (add cinnamon if you like).

Carl Babcoke's wife Virginia served these to us and they are good -- not too sweet.
