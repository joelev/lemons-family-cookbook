Clean LEAF BY LEAF and wash through 2 or 3 pans of water. Drain, and add 6 or 8 green onions & 6 or 8 radishes. Sprinkle 1 tsp. salt & 3 tbs. sugar over lettuce mixture.

In skillet, cut up & fry 3 or 4 slices bacon till crisp. If you don't want the bacon, just use about 1/4 cup bacon grease. Add 1/4 cup vinegar & 2 tablespoons water. Just before serving, heat together until very hot, and pour over lettuce.

Adjust the ingredients to your taste. You can use head lettuce and winter onions, but they are not as good as my "YARDEN" ones. Wayne can eat a lot of this.
