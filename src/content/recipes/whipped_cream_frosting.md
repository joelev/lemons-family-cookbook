Soften 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin in 1 Tablespoon cold water for 5 min. Heat until the gelatin melts. Add the melted gelatin to 1 cup whipping cream, whisked so the gelatin & cream are well combined. Chill the cream mixture for at least an hour.

Before whipping, sweeten (2 TBS powdered sugar & 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to 1 cup whipping cream). Whip with electric mixer until the cream is very thick & holds its shape. This willl thicken even more after refrigeration, & will hold up to 2 or 3 days.
