title: "Meringue"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "Beat together 3 egg whites (room temp), 1/4 teaspoon cream of tarter, and 1/8 teaspoon salt till frothy. Continue beating, and gradually add 6 Tablespoons sugar. Beat until stiff and glossy then add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Pile meringue onto hot pie -- make sure the edges are sealed so it will not pull away from the crust. Bake till peaks are brown -- 8 to 10 min. I like it better plain."
