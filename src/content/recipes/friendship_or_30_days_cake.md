You need a FRIEND to give you 1 1/2 cups starter. Sherry's mother, Esther Cooper, gave me mine before Mike's family went to Germany in 1982. Or you can start it with brandy or rum.

1st Day:

In a wide mouth glass or plastic jar mix together & stir until well blended:

- 1 1/2 cups starter
- 2 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 29 oz. can chopped peaches, with juice

Cover with loose fitting lid, and stir every day for 10 days. 10th Day, Add: 2 1/2 cups sugar 1 20 oz. can crushed pineapple with juice (or can use chunked). Stir every day for next 10 days. 20th Day, Add: 2 10 oz. jars maraschino cherries, cut in halves, with juice. Stir next 10 days. 30th Day (hence the name 30 Day Cake): Drain the fruit. There will be enough fruit for 3 cakes, and starter for 4 cakes. Give 1 1/2 cups to friends or you can divide it and freeze. Most recipes say not to refrigerate, but I have frozen it, and it works fine.
