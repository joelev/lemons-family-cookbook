title: "Cream Cheese Topping"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
---

- 1 8 oz. package cream cheese
- 1 stick margerine (don't use soft)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar

Cream together, and spread over cake. I sprinkle with chopped pecans.

Mary Beth won the "Voice of Democracy" speaking contest one year, and we were invited to the dinner at the V.F.W. hall. Jessie Glass had baked this cake (her daughteer, Marilyn, had gotten it from a black girl she worked with in Kansas City). Wayne liked it so well, he asked for the recipe. The next morning on his news-cast, he told about the aware dinner, and "one of the best cakes he had eaten", then gave the recipe as the "Jessie Glass Cake". I suppose we will never know the real name, but I think everybody in Dallas County baked it that day. Before the day was over, we started getting phone calls -- he had left out one of the key ingredients -- the sugar. The next morning, after a profuse apology, he gave it again, and it has been passed around all over the country -- except it had now become the "Wayne Lemons Cake".
