story: "Mom, Naomi, and Lorea used to make scalded dumplings by making a \"well\" in a bowl of flour, dipping out a cup of hot broth, adding 1 ts. baking powder, and maybe a little butter if the broth wasn't rich enough, and just stirring till stiff enough to handle. Sometimes they wouldn't even roll them out, just pinch off and drop into broth."

Place chicken in large pan. Cover with water, and add 1/2 teaspoon salt for each pound of chicken. If you want a little spice, put a bay leaf in, or a little chopped onion or celery. I usually just cook mine plain since Mom never heard of a bay leaf, and she made the best chicken and dumplings I have ever eaten. I think the main reason was she always just went out and killed an old hen so it was fresh chicken to start with. Unfortunately, it is hard now to find a hen that hasn't been frozen.

If you use a fryer, you may need to add a little butter unless it is very fat and weighs 3 or 4 pounds. Cook over medium heat, adding water as necessary, until chicken is tender. Remove from pan and place in oven to brown to carve, or you can just cut up the chicken, and leave it in the broth with the dumplings. Or, if you want to do it REALLY right, cut meat off bone, and add to dumplings.

Sweet Milk Dumplings

- 1 cup milk
- 3 Tablespoons shortening
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Place in mixing bowl, add 1 1/2 to 2 cups flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out on floured board and roll about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into strips, and drop in hot broth. Cook until tender -- probably 15 or 20 minutes. If you cook them too long, they will just dissolve.
