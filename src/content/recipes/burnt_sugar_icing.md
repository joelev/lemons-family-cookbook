title: "Burnt Sugar Icing"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "Melt margerine in heavy sauce-pan. Remove from heat and stir in the salt and flour. Stir in the caramelized water mixture slowly and return to heat. Boil 1 minute -- it may curdle, but this is o.k. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Beat powdered sugar and water alternately until it is the consistency to spread. Add vanilla. Ice."
