- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1 cup sugar
- 3 Tablespoons corn starch
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 box strawberry jello
- 1 quart fresh strawberries

Pour the water in a heavy saucepan, and bring to slow simmer over moderate heat. Sift together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Gradually stir into water, and cook until mixture thickens. Stir in the jello. Cool mixture and pour over the strawberries, which have been arranged in a baked pie crust, either plain crust, or graham cracker crust. Chill several hours, and serve with whipped cream. This also makes a good topping for CHEESE CAKE.
