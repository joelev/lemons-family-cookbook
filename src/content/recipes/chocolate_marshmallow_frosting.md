- 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate
- 1 cup minature marshmallows
- 2 to 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/4 cup water

In double boiler, combine chocolate, butter, marshmallows, & water. Cool & stir until ingredients are melted. Cool slightly. Add sugar & vanilla. Beat until smooth and thick enough to spread. May add nuts if you like. I substitue 6 Tablespoons cocoa & 2 Tablespoons shortening for the chocolate.
