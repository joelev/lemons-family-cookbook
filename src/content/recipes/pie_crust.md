For 1 pie crust (I double mine):

- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup shortening (can use oil)
- 1/4 cup water (if you use oil, use 1/3

Sift flour and salt into mixing bowl. Cut in shortening -- I mix with my hand until it feels "grainy". If it feels too greasy, add a little more flour. Add just enough cold water to moisten. 1/4 cup should do it, but experiment. Too much water will make the crust tough. Not enough makes it greasy, and it will fall apart. Mix with spoon until it forms a soft dough. Turn out on to floured board (actually, I use newspaper with wax paper on it so the mess is easy to clean up). Gently work in enough flour to handle.

Roll till thin. You will have to turn it over a time or two. Use enough flour to keep from sticking to rolling pin. Fold dough over, and place in pie pan. If you are making 1 curst pies, pour filling in, then trim and flute edges. For cream pies, cook over the bottom side of the pie pan for a better shaped crust. For 2 crust pies don't trie crust unto you have put in the filling, and put the top crust on. Be sure to cut holes in top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.

Bake crust at 425 degrees till done. Too much flour makes it hard.
