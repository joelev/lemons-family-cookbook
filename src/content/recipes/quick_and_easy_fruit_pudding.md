story: "Lorea gave me this recipe -- she was such a marvelous cook. I loved spending summers with her and Kenneth when I was young. We worked hard, but we got to go to Buffalo every Saturday, & she always made sure I had some money to spend. She taught me a lot about cooking & gardening. I miss her & all the little things we shared. Sisters are so special -- especially mine."

Melt 1/2 stick margerine in baking dish. Pour any kind of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit sweetend to taste, over margerine. Out favorite is just to slice 3 or 4 fresh apples, 1/4 cup sugar and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, etc.)

Mix together, and pour over fruit:

- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup milk

Bake at 375-400 degrees oven until the fruit bubbles up through the batter, and the top is brown. We take it right out of the oven and eat with ice cream over it.
