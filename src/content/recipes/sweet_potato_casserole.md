Peel & boil a medium size pan of sweet potatoes in water till ready to mash. Drain & mash as you would white potatoes. Add plenty of butter, salt to taste, & add enough milk to make creamy.

Put a layer of sweet potatoes in baking dish. Place a layer of regular size marshmallows on top of this. Spread another layer of the potatoes, then sprinkle with chopped pecans. This can be prepared ahead of time. When ready to serve, just pop into oven long enough to make the marshmallows melt & bubble.
