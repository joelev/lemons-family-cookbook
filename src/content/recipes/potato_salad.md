title: "Potato Salad"

Peel & boil in salted water enough potatoes to make a large bowl full. Boil until just tender enough to chop in small pieces. Drain & chop potatoes.

Add:

- 1 small minced onion
- 3 chopped hard boiled eggs
- 1/2 cup chopped sweet pickles
- A little chopped pimento if you like the flavor
- 1/2 teaspoon celery seed
- 2 tablespoons (more or less) prepared mustard
- 6 tablespoons Miracle Whip

I don't measure this very accurately, but usually mix and taste. I add enough of the pickle juice to make it thin enough to stir easily. If it is too sweet, add a little vinegar. I place in bowl, and shred American or Cheddar cheese on top & sprinkle with paprika. Keep cold.
