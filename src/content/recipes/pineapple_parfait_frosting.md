title: "Pineapple Parfait Frosting"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
story: "Place over rapidly boiling water, beat constantly with rotary beater until holds peak (7 minutes). Add 1/3 teaspoon grated lemon rind. Spread between layers, and cover top and sides of cake. I like to sprinkle coconut over this, but if Lyn is around leave it off -- she does not like coconut."
