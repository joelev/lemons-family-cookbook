- 1 #2 can Double Q salmon
- 1 cup crushed cracker crumbs
- 1/4 cup corn meal
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons oil

Put salmon in bowl & pick out the skin & dark parts. Leave the bone in -- this makes it crunchy. Flake salmon then mix in the well beaten egg. Add enough cracker crumbs & corn meal to make it thick enough to shape into patties.

Fry in oil on medium-hot griddle or skillet, turn to brown on both sides.

Mike used to ask for these for his birthday dinner, and I still like to make them for him -- and me.

Salmon Loaf

Make as above, except form in loaf in a greased baking dish & bake 30-40 minutes in 375 degrees oven or till done & brown on top. Slice and serve.
