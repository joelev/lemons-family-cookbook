- 1/8 cup margerine or butter
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup waffle syrup (Pretty sure she means corn syrup. - Joel)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla WATKINS
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 cup chopped pecans

Cream sugar and shortening. Add eggs and beat well. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Pour into unbaked pie shell. Decorate top with whole pecans.

Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake until done -- probably 25 min.

I began baking this pie when Wayne first came home from Guam. I haven't found a better recipe. It has a custard consistency, so is not so sticky. If you want to make "TASSIES" use cream cheese pastry, and bake in muffin pans.
