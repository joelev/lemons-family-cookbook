title: "Corn Bread"
category: quickbreads-muffins-pancakes
story: "My favorite bread. We used to shell our own corn and Dad would take it to the mill to have ground. We would usually run out of flour before we did meal so we would have to eat corn bread for breakfast -- I loved it."

- 1 egg
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons flour
- About 4 cups cornmeal

Beat egg and add other ingredients in order given and mix well. It may not take quite 4 cups meal -- the batter should not be too thick, just so it will pour easily. Grease pan with bacon grease if you have, and sprinkle meal in bottom of pan and lightly brown before pouring batter. Bake in hot oven till good and brown.
