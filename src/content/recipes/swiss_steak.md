Salt & pepper serving size pieces of round steak. Pound flour into meat & brown on both sides in hot shortening -- just enough to keep from sticking. Place layer of onions & 1 can tomatoes over steak. Reduce heat, cover and cook till meat is tender (1 hour).

If Glen is not here, add mangoes & cook little longer.
