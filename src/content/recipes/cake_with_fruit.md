title: "Cake With Fruit"
category: cakes-pies-frostings
---

- 1 box yellow cake mix
- 1 box instant vanilla pudding mix
- 3/4 cups oil
- 4 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups brandied fruit
- 1 cup nut meats, if desired. I use pecans, or English walnuts.

Blend together in order given, and bake in a well greased and floured bundt pan (or can use loaf pan) at 350 degrees for 60 minutes, or until done. Remove from pan and cool.

This really doesn't need icing, but it is good with a thin creamy icing drizzled over it -- 3 cups p. sugar, 1/3 cup margerine, 1 ts. vanilla, and about 3 TS. milk (more if needed). These cakes freeze well.
